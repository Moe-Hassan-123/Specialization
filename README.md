# Specialization

THIS IS CS50's Final Project

Description:

In Egypt Students entering grade 11 have to write on a paper what speciality of studying they want and go to school to give it to the head quarter,
Then Teachers across the country would spend enormous amount of time and energy to list every student's preferences and their number and name.
which as any sensible human knows, will cause a lot of problems as humans aren't perfect.

So I with my newfound savvy programming skills decided to take on initiative and implemented a fully functional web site that allows students from all over Egypt to safely
register with their national id so they can choose their studying specialities.
